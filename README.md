# poorly coded comics

I love [Poorly Drawn Lines](http://www.poorlydrawnlines.com),
but I never remember to check the site for updates.
This small task server will periodically check for new comics and,
if found, will then send a text alert.

Because laughs.

It also fetches [xkcd](https://xkcd.com)!
